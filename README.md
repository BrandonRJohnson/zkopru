# Zkopru Withdrawal web explorer

## Background

Zkopru is a shorthand for zero knowledge optimistic rollup. As Ethereum continues to expand and Ethereum 2.0 continues development it's important that the throughput, or the amount of transactions the network can process at any given time, continues to increase to meet demand. Layer 2 scaling solutions (solutions that happen off the main blockchain) can increase transactions from around 10 per second to 2,000 per second.

## Utility of the web explorer.

While rollups greatly increases the number of transactions per second that can be handled, they come with some drawbacks. Specifically in this case there is a tradeoff in terms of liqudity. In order to ensure that there is no fraud most transactions require about 7 days to be verified before the funds can be accessed. What the website does is it provides a place for people who want to access their funds more quickly to ask others to front their withdrawal. In exchange for fronting the withdrawal, the person fronting gets a small reward on top of the initial amount they gave.
